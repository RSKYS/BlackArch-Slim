# BlackArch-Slim

This is my personal experiment list. \
After you add blackarch-keyring and blackarch-mirrorlist from one of their official repositories, you can use their mirrors on top of your Arch or something based on it.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/RSKYS/BlackArch-Slim
$ cd BlackArch-Slim
$ sudo su
# pacman -Syu - < slim-list
```
